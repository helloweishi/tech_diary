title: algorithm for ML
summary:
1, Linear Regression
2, Logistic Regression -- coefficients that weight each input variable
3, Linear Discriminant Analysis --limited to only two-class classification problems
4, Classification and Regression Trees -- predictive modeling 
5, Naive Bayes --two types of probabilities that can be calculated directly from your training data: 
                 1) The probability of each class; and 
                 2) The conditional probability for each class given each x value
                 the probability model can be used to make predictions for new data using Bayes Theorem
6, K-Nearest Neighbors -- determine the similarity between the data instances, use the Euclidean distance
                          weekness: hang on entire training dataset
7, Learning Vector Quantization -- choose how many training instances to hang onto and learns exactly what those instances should look like
                                   collection of codebook vectors
                                   
8, Support Vector Machines
9, Bagging and Random Forest
10, Boosting and AdaBoost
