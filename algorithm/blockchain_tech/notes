3, ICO alternative: Initial Loan Procurements (ILPs) 
    ILPs enable borrowers and creditors to enter into 
    a loan agreement through legally binding smart contracts. 
    With an ILP, a creditor's investment is contractually tied to 
    the performance of the company and eliminates the wild swings of 
    volatility that have been associated with a vast number of ICOs. 
    In simple terms, as long as the company makes a profit, the creditor gets annual returns.
