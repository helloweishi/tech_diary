summary: 
By “augmenting human intellect” we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, 
to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this 
respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility 
of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better 
solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by “complex situations” 
we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, 
attorneys, designers -- whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated 
clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, 
intangibles, and the human “feel for a situation” usefully coexist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, 
sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.
