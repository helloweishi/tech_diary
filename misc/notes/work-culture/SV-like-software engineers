status: done
summary: 
1. Autonomy for software engineers: encouraged to figure out the "how" of the work
      The expectation from developers at traditional companies is to complete assigned work. At SV-like companies, it's to solve problems that the business has
2. Curious problem solvers, not mindless resources: solve the problems that the organization has, not only for technical skills but communication and problem-solving ability.
3. Internal data, code, and documentation transparency: often have access to realtime business metrics
4. Exposure to the business and to business metrics: encouraged to interact with the rest of the business.
5. Engineer-to-engineer comms over triangle-communication: encourage engineer-to-engineer communication, cutting out middlemen
6. Investing in a less frustrating developer experience: great return that helps these companies move faster, and developers stay happier
7. Higher leverage --> higher {autonomy, pay}: leverage software engineers in growing the business.

"SV-like" companies think of engineers as value generators, and creative problem solvers. Traditional companies think of them as factory workers.
