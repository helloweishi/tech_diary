summary: 
It is physics - you know the sort of first principles reasoning. â€¦ 
What I mean by that is boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there as opposed to reasoning by analogy.
when you want to do something new you have to apply the physics approach,
also really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it, particularly from friends
