summary:
1. pragma , restrict compiler's version no less than specified version number, or should be exact version number specified
if version start with ^
2. path remap: with format "context:prefix=target" in solc compiler command line, 
   context: All imports in files in or below the directory context
   prefix:  import a file that starts with
   target:  redirected by replacing prefix by target
   
   If there are multiple remappings that lead to a valid file, the remapping with the longest common prefix is chosen.
   for absolute includes, just add the remapping =/
   
   sample:
   import "github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/library/iterable_mapping.sol" as it_mapping;
   compile command: solc github.com/ethereum/dapp-bin/=/usr/local/dapp-bin/ source.sol
   
Remix provides an automatic remapping for github

3. commenting, // or /* */; triple slash (///) or a double asterisk block(/** ... */) should 
be used directly above function declarations or statements, used for document function.
