Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) : conference for search engine

Inverted Index(Early Days Of Search)
  inverted lists: book Introduction to Information Retrieval by Christopher D. Manning
                  https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html
Sharding - Parallelization: 
        A fixed number of shards distributed across different servers
        A distributed computation of the inverted index (indexing, one thread per shard)
        A distributed computation of the search results across the different shards (searching, one thread per shard), finalized by a fast merge of the N results
High Availability And Scaling Of Search:

Current Challenges Of Search Engines:
        Sub-minute addition/removal of machines, dynamic add/remove machine
        dynamic number of shards
        Separation of search and indexing
        Leveraging the evolution of network bandwidth
        Native multi-tenant optimization
