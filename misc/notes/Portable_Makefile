summary:
1, in order to get reliable POSIX behavior, the first non-comment line of the Makefile must be .POSIX
2, Each command line must start with a tab character
3, Each line is run in its own shell, so be mindful of using commands like cd, which won’t affect later lines.
4, add the .SUFFIXES special target to the top, erasing all the built-in inference rules.
5, make’s -e flag to set overriding macros definitions from the environment
6,
 .POSIX:
.SUFFIXES:
...
.SUFFIXES: .c .o
.c.o:
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<
 The first empty .SUFFIXES clears the suffix list. The second one adds .c and .o to the now-empty suffix list.
