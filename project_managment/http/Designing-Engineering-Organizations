Product-aligned vs technology-aligned
product-aligned: each team is responsible for some piece of your public-facing product
Technology-aligned: organizations break down based more on backend technology

Generally, product-aligned teams deliver better products more rapidly, if delivering a new feature requires several teams to coordinate, you’ll struggle

Stable vs project-based teams
stable teams: Teams are long-lived, and projects come to teams
Project-based teams: form to tackle a specific project, and dissolve when it ends

Generally, stable teams produce better results.

Single- vs interdisciplinary
Single-disciplinary teams group staff by skill-set 
Interdisciplinary teams combine all the pieces a team needs to execute under one roof

Generally, interdisciplinary teams outperform organizations built with single-discipline teams, but challenges around reporting chains
and performance review.

Reporting chains: delivery-aligned or skills-aligned
skills-aligned reporting chains: people report to managers who match their skill-set.
delivery-aligned reporting chains: staff reports to the manager of their delivery team

Generally, delivery-aligned is more effective, Skills-aligned teams can struggle with actually shipping.
organizations with delivery-aligned teams need to create other channels for domain-specific guidance and feedback.

optimize for delivery, then stable, multi-disciplinary, and product-aligned should the principles that guide how you form teams.
