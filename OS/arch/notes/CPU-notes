title: CPU notes
summary:
CPI: Cycle Per Instruction
IPC: Instruction Per Cycle
ILP: instruction-level parallelism
Clock Speed is limited by the length of longest, slowest stage in pipeline; subdividing long stage will raise latency, but throughput better.
processor's width: the number of instructions able to issued, executed, or completed per cycle
superpipeline: split pipeline into more stages
superscalar: add more function units, which allow more instructions in parallel at each stage.
DSP: digital signal processors
VLIW: Very Long Instruction Word
instruction's latency: The number of cycles between when an instruction reaches the execute stage 
                       and when its result is available for use by other instructions
