title: CPU notes
summary:
CPI: Cycle Per Instruction
IPC: Instruction Per Cycle
ILP: instruction-level parallelism
Clock Speed is limited by the length of longest, slowest stage in pipeline; subdividing long stage will raise latency, but throughput better.
processor's width: the number of instructions able to issued, executed, or completed per cycle
superpipeline: split pipeline into more stages
superscalar: add more function units, which allow more instructions in parallel at each stage.
DSP: digital signal processors
VLIW: Very Long Instruction Word
instruction's latency: The number of cycles between when an instruction reaches the execute stage 
                       and when its result is available for use by other instructions
hurdle for pipeline: branches, instruction dependencies&latency

instruction scheduling:
out-of-order execution: Doing dynamic instruction scheduling (reordering) in the processor means the dispatch logic must be enhanced 
                        to look at groups of instructions and dispatch them out of order as best it can to use the processor's functional units
register renaming: processor keep a mapping of the instructions in flight at any moment and the physical registers they use
OOO logic consumes lot of power for a relatively small performance gain, which limited it only appear at high-performance processor, not lower-power.
