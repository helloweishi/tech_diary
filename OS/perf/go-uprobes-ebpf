link: https://github.com/grantseltzer/oster
tag: go, ebpf
status: none
summary:
  adding a line to the /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events
  uprobe inject: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/uprobetracer.txt
sample: 
  echo 'r:bashReadline /bin/bash:0xd5690 cmd=+0($retval):string' >> /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events
  # When the uprobe is added, activate it with this command:
  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/bashReadline/enable
  # log
  cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe
If you receive the error Device or resource busy while writing to the uprobe_events file, set /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enabled to 0 and try again.
If you receive Invalid argument, read the /sys/kernel/tracing/error_log file for details.
Your kernel must have CONFIG_UPROBES enabled
