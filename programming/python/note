performance improvement tips: https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/11/10-smart-performance-hacks-for-faster-python-code/
1: Membership testing with a list (x in some_list) requires scanning each element one by one, time complexity (O(n))
   sets in Python are implemented as hash tables, which allow for constant-time (O(1)) lookups on average.
2: Avoid unnecessary copies 
3: Use __slots__ for memory efficiency :explicitly declare a fixed set of attributes for a class
4: Use math functions instead of operators
5: Pre-allocate memory with known sizes
6: Avoid exception handling in hot loops
7: Use local functions for repeated logic
8: Use itertools for combinatorial operations
9: Use bisect for sorted list operations
10: Avoid repeated function calls in loops
