CPU info: https://uops.info/table.html
    sample:
          AVX and FMA operate on data stored in special 256-bit YMM registers. Each YMM register can hold up to 256/32 = 8 packed single-precision (32-bit) floats. 
          VFMADD213PS (PS stands for PackedSingle) and takes three registers (YMM1, YMM2, YMM3) as input to calculate YMM1 * YMM2 + YMM3 and store the result in YMM3
          the throughput (TP) of fused-multiply-add is 0.5 cycles/instruction or 2 instructions/cycle
          Theoretically, the CPU can execute 32 FLOP per cycle = 8 (floats in YMM register) * 2 (add + mul) * 2 (1/TP)
          5.1 GHz in single-threaded tasks = 5.1GHz * 32 FLOP/cycle = 163 GFLOPS for single-threaded matmul
